## Description


This project represents an e-commerce application's server side routes and logic. It highlights the necessity of closing the request/response cycle and shows why separating routes can be beneficial for organization purposes. The most difficult aspect of this project was trying to understand the primary and foreign key relationships. In the future, a front end would be a good way for the user to enter information into the database more easily.
